  * CRDesktopWindow.cpp, main.cpp: the uttsc client seems to tendy to
    crash under certain situations when it is used with a geometry instead
    of fullscreen. Hence, we just use the uttsc client in dtlogin mode
    where fullscreen is the only choice. Also fixed the keyLayout spec for
    an english keyboard in case rdesktop is used.

2007-04-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * CRDesktopWindow.cpp: the client name will now be passed to the remote
    desktop client's with the "-n" option.

2007-03-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * CRDesktopWindow.cpp: we only use "uttsc" in case a -dtlogin session is
    running. Somehow that damn 'uttsc' client doesn't allow to switch
    from/to fullscreen mode dynamically like rdesktop does. However, our
    users are used to that.

2007-03-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * CRDesktopWindow.cpp: removed the uttsc/rdesktop information from the
    .slist file and added some 'magic' to automatically search for the
    the possibility to use the SunRay 'uttsc' terminal server client
    instead.

  * CRDesktopWindow.cpp: removed the per default added "-N" option for
    enabling the NUM-lock synchronization. It seems to prevent some users
    from actually using the numeric pad at all.

  * lang: added german translation of qrdesktop and enabled it per default.
  * misc: enabled qrdesktop to also use the new "uttsc" terminal server
    client from SUN. Now the .slist file can have an additional option to
    specify the specific RDP command tool which should be used.

2005-08-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * In "-dtlogin" mode, the Quit button is now called "Logout".
  * the displayed serverlist is now read from an eventually existing
    "qrdesktop.slist" file instead of having the serverlist hardcoded.
  * changed CRDesktopWindow class to be inheriented from QMainWindow
  * fixed a Qt 4.0.1 related bug where the use of two QSettings() objects
    caused the application to hang if used in -dtlogin mode.
   
2005-07-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * added "-dtlogin" option which automatically ensures that qrdesktop
    will not close automatically upon start of 'rdesktop'. It will also
    ensure that only 'Fullscreen' is selectable in the GUI.
  * rdesktop is now always started in default nice mode.

2005-07-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * added ability to save user specific settings on each use of
    the application via a QSettings object. Now qrdesktop will save
    the position, the servername, the resolution, the color depth
    and the chosen keyboard layout on each rdesktop execution. So
    each user should have his own private settings now.
  * added ESC and RETURN key recognition such that the application
    will immediately react on the key press of return/enter and
    escape and either start rdesktop or quit the application.
  * added automatic color depth recognition to either set the
    private colormode option '-C' or not. Previously '-C' was
    always set.
  * added automatic screen resolution recognition and selection
    of the screen resolution such that always a window is present

2005-07-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * added "-C" option to default rdesktop execution to make
    sure a private colormap is always used so that on 8bit displays
    more colors will be available.

2005-07-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * initial checkin and 1.0 release
