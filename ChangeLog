  * added "-dtlogin" option which automatically ensures that qrdesktop
    will not close automatically upon start of 'rdesktop'. It will also
    ensure that only 'Fullscreen' is selectable in the GUI.
  * rdesktop is now always started in default nice mode.

  * added ability to save user specific settings on each use of
    the application via a QSettings object. Now qrdesktop will save
    the position, the servername, the resolution, the color depth
    and the chosen keyboard layout on each rdesktop execution. So
    each user should have his own private settings now.
  * added ESC and RETURN key recognition such that the application
    will immediately react on the key press of return/enter and
    escape and either start rdesktop or quit the application.
  * added automatic color depth recognition to either set the
    private colormode option '-C' or not. Previously '-C' was
    always set.
  * added automatic screen resolution recognition and selection
    of the screen resolution such that always a window is present

  * added "-C" option to default rdesktop execution to make
    sure a private colormap is always used so that on 8bit displays
    more colors will be available.

  * initial checkin and 1.0 release
